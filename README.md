# CU Mechatronics

## What are you looking at?
This is the repository for our group in the CU Mechanical Engineering Departments Mechatronics class taught by Professor Derek Reamon. This repo contains some of the labs and homeworks our team has worked on as well as our main group project. Our project for the semester is to create an autonomous robot that is capable of playing our version of Rocket League (Or soccer) against another robot. The rules are pretty open ended but we are restricted to a $200 budget and are given the position of our robot, the oppoenent and the ball via an overhead camera system transmitting radio waves.

## How are we gonna win?
Thats a trade secret. However, our team is designing a four wheel mecanum drive robot. We are including a IMU, pixy cam and potentially a soleniod to "kick" the ball. We hope we can contribute our success to an advanced software algorithm, high quality components and a robust mechanical and electrical system.
